# MineSweeperSolver
This was a short holiday project to see how quickly I could create an algorithm to solve the classic Minesweeper game. However, as this code works algorithmically, without intuition nor the ability to "work things out", it doesn't usually finish the game in full! Despite this, I was able to create this code within a few days, and was proud of how successful and satisfying it is to watch!
