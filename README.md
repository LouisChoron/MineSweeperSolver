# MineSweeperSolver
This was a short holiday project to see how quickly I could create an algorithm to solve the classic Minesweeper game. However, sadly, as this code works algorithmically without intuition nor the ability to "work things out", it doesn't usually finish the game in full! Despite this, I was able to create this code within a few days, and was proud of how successful and satisfying it is to watch!

### Running
Ensure that the image files and code file are in the same directory, then simply run the code.

### Future Improvements
- Use machine learning to tackle the problem intuitively. There are often cases where future moves could be worked out through thought, however cannot all be included into the algorithm, due to the large number of possible situations! These are called "minesweeper patterns" and I attempted to include the most common at the end of the code, however there have been many left out!
- Investigate including parallelisation.
