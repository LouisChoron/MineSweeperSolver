# MineSweeperSolver
This was a holiday project to see how quickly I could create an algorithm to solve the classic Minesweeper game. However, the code doesn't usually finish the game, as it works algorithmically, without intuition nor the ability to "work things out". I was able to create this code within a few days, and was proud of it!
